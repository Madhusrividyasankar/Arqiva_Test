# Dynamic String Web Service

## What I Built
A web service that displays a dynamic string which can be updated without redeployment.

## Components Used

1. **AWS Lambda**
   - Used to serve the web page
   - Reads string from S3
   - File: index.mjs

2. **Amazon S3**
   - Bucket name: "dynamicstring"
   - Stores the dynamic string in a text file
   - File name: "dynamic-string.txt"

3. **API Gateway**
   - Provides HTTP endpoint to access the Lambda
   - URL: https://jgwpk691s4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/fetch-string

## How It Works
1. User visits the API Gateway URL
2. Lambda function is triggered
3. Lambda reads the string from S3
4. Returns HTML with the dynamic string

## Code Structure
```
- index.mjs     (Lambda function)
```

## How to Update the String
1. Go to S3 bucket "dynamicstring"
2. Upload new text file or edit "dynamic-string.txt"
3. New string appears immediately for all users

## Future Improvements
1. Add a simple web interface to update the string
2. Add security features

## Why I Made These Choices
- Used Lambda + API Gateway for serverless architecture
- Chose S3 for simple string storage
- Used ES Modules for modern JavaScript
- Added CORS headers for browser access
